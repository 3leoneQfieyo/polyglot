One way to get a license key is to use a keygen program that can generate one for you. A keygen is a small application that can create serial numbers or activation codes for various software products. One of the most popular keygens for Autodesk products is Xforce Keygen, which can work for Autodesk 2006-2020 all products on Windows and Mac.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Xforce Keygen to activate Autodesk Inventor 2008 Professional on your computer. Please note that this method is not legal or endorsed by Autodesk, and may violate their terms of service and license agreement. Use it at your own risk.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install Autodesk Inventor 2008 Professional
 
Before you can activate Autodesk Inventor 2008 Professional, you need to download and install it on your computer. You can get the installation files from the official Autodesk website or from other sources. Make sure you download the correct version for your operating system (32-bit or 64-bit).
 
After downloading the installation files, run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions on the screen. You will be asked to enter a serial number and a product key during the installation process. You can use any of these serial numbers:
 
- 666-69696969
- 667-98989898
- 400-45454545
- 066-66666666

And use this product key: 462-00000000
 
These are generic serial numbers and product keys that will allow you to install the software, but not activate it. You will need to use Xforce Keygen later to generate a valid activation code.
 
## Step 2: Download and Run Xforce Keygen
 
Xforce Keygen is a small application that can generate activation codes for various Autodesk products. You can download it from various websites, such as AppNee[^1^], LexCliq[^2^], or Peatix[^3^]. Make sure you download the correct version for your software and operating system (32-bit or 64-bit).
 
After downloading Xforce Keygen, extract it from the zip file and run it as administrator. You will see a window like this:

## Step 3: Activate Autodesk Inventor 2008 Professional
